Advent of Code 2015
===================
### 25 languages in 25 days

Commitment: solve each puzzle in Advent of Code 2015 in a different programming language. To make it more "interesting", the languages will be in alphabetical order (day 1 language starts with A, day 2 with B, ...). This means I can skip one letter. Yay! (Hmm, maybe I should wait for Y.)

day    | language | notes
-------|----------|-------
day 1  | APL      | Interesting language; very expressive. The difficult part is figuring out what it can do, and then copy/pasting weird control symbols.
day 2  | BASIC    | I suspect I'm biased towards functional languages, so I chose BASIC for B... to compensate, so to say. Also, I used to write BASIC as a child, so I might have been nostalgically motivated :)
day 3  | Clean    | A hidden gem! This was very fun and rewarding to learn. It's probably quite similar to Haskell (which I don't know enough to be sure).
