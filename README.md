Advent of Code 2015
===================
### 25 languages in 25 days

Commitment: solve each puzzle in Advent of Code 2015 in a different programming language. To make it more "interesting", the languages will be in alphabetical order (day 1 language starts with A, day 2 with B, ...). This means I can skip one letter. Yay! (Hmm, maybe I should wait for Y.)
